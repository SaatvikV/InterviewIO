#InterviewIO
## Inspiration
As CS students always on the internship grind, we wanted to find a way to practice interviewing without having to talk to another human being.
## What it does
The AI will ask you questions, and you record your answer. At the end of the interview, the Interview History section will replay your conversation and list the AI-provided feedback.
## How we built it
We built our frontend with React and our backend with Flask. 
## Challenges we ran into
None of us were experienced in React and Flask, so we had to dive headfirst into figuring out API calls, javascript, html, and css.   
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
pain
## What's next for InterviewIO
making the interview experience even more realistic by adding a real talking face.
